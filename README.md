## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **blogging platform** built for writers and bloggers who prefer **Markdown syntax** for writing posts. It allows users to create and preview blog posts in real-time using Markdown, and save them locally for future viewing.

The project demonstrates the ability to build a minimal yet functional blog system without relying on heavy CMS tools. It serves as a foundation for more advanced content management systems.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Traditional CMS tools like WordPress or Drupal can be overkill for simple blogging needs. Bloggers need **lightweight and flexible platforms** where they can focus on writing without complex formatting tools.

> ❝ Markdown provides an elegant way to format text quickly and cleanly. ❞

## 🎯 Objective

Create a responsive, user-friendly blog platform that:

- Allows users to write blog posts using Markdown
- Shows a live preview of the rendered post
- Saves blog data locally or using a mock backend
- Lists previously written blog entries
- Uses open-source tools like **marked.js** for Markdown rendering
